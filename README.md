# Erlspec Expectations [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jdantonio/erlspec-expectations.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jdantonio/erlspec-expectations?branch=master)

RSpec inspired test expectations for Erlang.

There's nothing wrong with the old-school *assert* macros provided by
[EUnit](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/eunit/chapter.html) and
[Common Test](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/common_test/basics_chapter.html).
They really are all you need. But I'm a Ruby guy and I love me some
[RSpec](http://rspec.info/) when I'm writing Ruby tests. My brain more
easily thinks in "should" symantics that "assert". So I wrote a bunch
of Erlang expectations inspired by RSpec. Use them if you like
